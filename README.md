### About Me :
I have a PhD in Physics and 10 years of experience as a Researcher in Academia. Now I am starting my career in data science. I have always loved uncovering insights from data and discovering something new about the world around us. My Data Science journey began in 2022 with taking "Data Analysis and Presentation Skills: the PwC Approach Specialization". After learning the basics of programming, I started my personal project to practice my skills in working with data, and I finished "IBM Introduction in Data Science Professional Certificate" on Coursera. This pushed me into the magnificent world of Data, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and AI. I successfully completed "IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate" on Coursera in January 2023. Currently, I am seeking opportunities to leverage my expertise and grow as a data scientist in a dynamic industry setting.

Working as a Researcher, I developed following transferable skills:
 -  Critical Thinking, 
 -  Analytical and Problem-Solving skills, 
 -  Adaptability, 
 -  Ability to Multitask,
 -  Ability to Work in a Multinational Team, 
 -  Communication and Presentation skills. 

I acquired technical skills such as 
 -  Programming (Python), 
 -  Data Cleaning, Exploration, and Visualization (Jupyter Lab, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, Excel),
 -  Supervised and Unsupervised Machine learning (Regression, Classification, Clustering, Scikit-Learn),
 -  Deep Learning (keras).
 
You can find my portfolio on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/semenvasilev) and here oh GitHub

Also, I got a "Google Project Management: Professional Certificate" and "Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt".

My scientific results were published in 25 articles. I presented my work at 15 International conferences in Portugal, Switzerland and Ireland.
