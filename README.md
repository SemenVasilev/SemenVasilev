### About Me :
I have a PhD in Physics and 10 years of experience as a Researcher in Academia. I have always loved uncovering insights from data and discovering something new about the world around us. Currently, I am working as a PostDoc at the University of Limerick in the group Data Analysis for Pharmaceutical Manufacturing. I study powder conveying by ML methods.

Working as a Researcher, I developed following transferable skills:
 -  Critical Thinking, 
 -  Analytical and Problem-Solving skills, 
 -  Adaptability, 
 -  Ability to Multitask,
 -  Ability to Work in a Multinational Team, 
 -  Communication and Presentation skills. 

I acquired technical skills such as 
 -  Programming (Python), 
 -  Data Cleaning, Exploration, and Visualization (Jupyter Lab, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, Excel),
 -  Supervised and Unsupervised Machine learning (Regression, Classification, Clustering, Scikit-Learn),
 -  Deep Learning (keras).
